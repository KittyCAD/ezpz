# Residual visualization baselines

These images are used for visual regression testing of constraint residual fields.
If you change residual math (or delete a baseline), regenerate with the **`TWENTY_TWENTY=overwrite`** env var so twenty_twenty writes the current output to the baseline paths.

```bash
just residual-viz-overwrite
```
