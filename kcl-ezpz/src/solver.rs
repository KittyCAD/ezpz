        Firstly, find the size of the relevant matrices.
        Each constraint yields 1 or more residual function f.
        Each residual function f is summed to form the overall residual F.
        Each residual function yields a derivative f'.
        The overall Jacobian is a matrix where
            each row is one of the residual functions.
            each column is a variable
            each cell represents the partial derivative of that column's variable,
            in that row's equation.
